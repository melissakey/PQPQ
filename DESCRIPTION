Description: protein quantification by peptide quality control    The PQPQ software improves the quantitative accuracy of mass spectrometry based on shotgun proteomics by selecting a subset of correlating peptides (or several such subsets of peptides) designed to best represent the quantitative profile of the protein.    This port specifically focuses on the peptide selection portion of this code; sections involved in reading and formatting the data are ignored (for now).
